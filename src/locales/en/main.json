Savvy may give incorrect answers to rare local queries or queries after 2021. It is recommended to verify answers' accuracy and use the model for more common questions. Additionally, Savvy also has access to GPT-4, providing higher-quality answers but with slower performance. The DALL¬∑E 3 neural network is used for image generation. Simply ask the bot to generate an image. For creating a brief summary of a YouTube video, Savvy analyzes subtitles, condenses the main idea, and can narrate the text using OpenAI."
